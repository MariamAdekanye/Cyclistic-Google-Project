# Google capstone project
Started my google data analytics course few months ago with the aim of acquiring the necessary skills to become a data analyst. I have been able to successfully complete the 8 courses of the course which has helped me gained the necessary skills. In this course, we were taken through the processes involved in analysis starting from the ask phase to the act phase. Also learnt the use of tools like spreadsheet, sql, tableau and R.
To round up the course, we were required to do a case study to build a portfolio, and below is mine.
In this case study, I worked as a junior data analyst who joined the team six months ago and have been learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how I can help Cyclistic achieve their goal.
